🔧 Built: Train Ollama on Your PDFs/Documents - Zero External Knowledge

🔧 Built: Train Ollama on Your PDFs/Documents - Zero External Knowledge
Open-source Python script that creates custom AI models from your documents using Ollama. Model only knows what you feed it.
⚡ What It Actually Does
Feed PDFs/docs → Script processes text → Creates Ollama model → AI answers only from your sources
Simple. Local. Your data never leaves your machine.
🎯 How It Works
📂 Input: Drop your PDFs, Word docs, text files
🔄 Process: Python extracts text, builds Q&A pairs from content
🤖 Deploy: Creates custom Ollama model trained only on your data

🔒 Key Benefits
🛡️ Complete Privacy
Runs entirely on your machine
No cloud APIs, no data uploads
Your documents stay local

🔓 Fully Open Source
Python + PyMuPDF + NLTK + Ollama
Uses open LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, etc.)
Code available for inspection/modification

📚 Source Restriction
AI literally cannot answer outside your documents
Ask about your manual? Detailed response from content
Ask about weather? "I don't have that information"
No hallucination from web training data

🌍 Practical Scope
Works with multiple documents (tested with 10–50 files)
Any language your base model supports
Good for: manuals, research papers, company docs

💼 Realistic Use Cases
🏢 Internal Training: Company procedures → Employee Q&A bot
📖 Study Aid: Course materials → Personal tutor for exams
🔬 Research: Paper collection → Quick reference system
📋 Documentation: Technical manuals → Support assistant
🚀 What You Get
Custom Ollama model trained on your content
Strict boundaries (won't reference external info)
Local deployment (no dependencies on external services)
Built on proven open-source tools

⚙️ Requirements
Hardware: 8GB+ RAM, decent CPU (processing depends on document size) Software: Python 3.8+, Ollama installed and running Dependencies: PyMuPDF, NLTK, tqdm (auto-installed by script) Base Model: At least one LLM in Ollama (script can pull llama3.2:3b automatically) Storage: ~2–5GB per custom model created
⚠️ Reality Check
Quality depends on your source material quality
Works best with well-structured documents
Processing time varies with document size (large PDFs = longer processing)
Not magic - just focused training on your data
Requires basic command line comfort for setup
